    "Object-oriented programming: As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Polymorphism\n",
    "2) Inheritance\n",
    "3) Encapsulation\n",
    "4) Abstraction\n",
    "5) Class\n",
    "6) Object\n",
    "7) Method\n",

    "A method is implicitly passed the object on which it is invoked.\n",
    "It may or may not return any data.\n",

    "Object:\n",
    "Object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. And, class is a blueprint for the object.\n",

    "Attiributes:\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods. In python, functions too are objects. So they have attributes like other objects. All functions have a built-in attribute __doc__, which returns the doc string defined in the function source code\n",
